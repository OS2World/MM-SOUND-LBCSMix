	LBCSMix v.1.00. A mixer for Crystal Semiconductors mode 2 codecs.


This is free software. It is distributed under GNU General Public License.
See file COPYING for details. There is NO WARRANTY. Use it at your own risk.

			INTRO

This is a simple mixer for Crystal Semiconductors mode 2 codecs (i.e. those
that work with version 1.xx drivers).


			INSTALLATION

Unpack the archive into a directory. If you install the mixer for the first time
then run install.cmd script, it will ask you about the card you use, then
create initial configyration and desktop object. Or simply launch the
executable and press Settings button to enter the configuration menu and 
specify the base port (the value specified in /P parameter of
BASEDEV=CWCONFIG.SYS in CONFIG.SYS). If you're updating from the previous
version then run update.cmd script that will remove window parameters stored
by the previous version from user ini file.


			USAGE

The codecs have 3 general purpose stereo inputs called Line, AUX1, AUX2
and a general purpose mono input called Mono. The assignment of those inputs
depends upon audio card design so their names can be redefined in the Settings
dialog to reflect your card's inputs assignment. Mono is usually either unused
or connected to motherboard's PC Speaker output. Stereo inputs are usually
connected to CD audio output, MIDI synth and Line In connector.

You can run only once copy at the same time, if you try to start another copy
at the same time it will beep and terminate immediately.

To use the lock feature you have to specify the lock rate in the settings
dialog. The lock rate is specified in milliseconds, the minimum is 1, the
maximum is 10000. However the real lock rate is specified in 55ms increments,
thus specifying values from 1 to 55 ms will result in 55 ms real lock rate.
If you don't intend to use the lock feature you'd better leave the lock rate
field in the settings dialog empty (thus not wasting your system resources 
running unnesessary lock thread).

You'd better keep all the unused inputs muted to minimize the noise level.

The user ini application name used to store mixer's data is "LBCSMix".


		INPUTS ASSIGNMENT FOR SOME CARDS

Right now I can tell only about Turtle Beach TBS-2000 inputs assignment:
AUX1 = Line In, AUX2 = CD, Line = internal MIDI synth (probably, I've never
used it really), Mono - unused.

For other cards you have to play with gain controls while listening to a music
from different sources to figure out your card's inputs assignment.


			CONTACT

You can send your bug reports and suggestions to e-mail
boga@fly.triniti.troitsk.ru or FIDO 2:5095/9. I'd appreciate if you send
me input assignments of different cards not listed in this file. The lastest
version of the mixer can be downloaded from
http://freebyte.ml.org/~boga/OS2Programs.html where you can also find a
couple of other useful OS/2 programs.


			HISTORY

0.01	- Initial version.
0.02	- Added ADC parameters setting.
	- Added a simple installation script.
	- Lock and Both states are now stored.
        - Mixer state is stored.
	- Either stored mixer state is restored on startup or
          mixer controls are initialized with values read from the chip
          (depending on "Restore mixer state on startup" option).
	- Now you can't start more than one copy of mixer at the same time.
	- Window position is now stored.
	- Setting are now stored in user ini file.
	- Added About box.
	- Lock is moved from the main thread to a separate thread with time
 	  critical priority.
0.03	- Re-designed main dialog to make it smaller
